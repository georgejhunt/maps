### Changes From 7.0
1. Data and program will be separated. The same program (/library/www/osm-vector-maps/viewer) will be used for all Regions.
2. Regional *.mbtiles will be installed to the /library/www/osm-vector-maps/tilesets/ directory.
3. All *.mbtiles sets, even the ones downloaded directly from http://openmaptiles.com, will be dispalyed by the viewer on the same map page. (NOTE: It is not yet known whether many mbtiles sets can be served without degraded performance).
